## Want to allow any item to go into the crafting grid?
This mod registers serveral groups that can be used to include items into the grid according to their technical category.

### Groups

* `group:node`: All registered nodes.
* `group:craftitem`: All registered craftitems.
* `group:tool`: All registered tools.
